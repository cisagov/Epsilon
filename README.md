# Epsilon Algorithm Suite
GPS has become an integral system for many industries, increasing the impact from GPS spoofing threats. Detecting spoofing attacks is an open research area and many anti-spoofing (AS) techniques have been published. While these techniques can be effective, many require access to internal receiver processing.
 
This code base is an implementation details of the Epsilon AS algorithms. These algorithms enable an end-user to have basic spoofing detection capabilities without any modifications to the existing GPS receiver. The algorithms only require information commonly provided by GPS receivers and do not have to be implemented on the receiver itself. When used together, these algorithms can detect the effects of targeted position, velocity, and clock spoofing attacks.
